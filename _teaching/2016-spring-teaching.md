As the head teaching assistant (TA) I was in charge of many administrative and weekly upkeep responsibilities in addition to the usual teaching weekly sections and grading.  I was the interface for the other TAs and the professor teaching the course.  Scheduling for TA responsibilities such as grading, making solutions and proctoring throughout the semester were done by me.  The number of TAs ranged from 7 to 10.  I was also responsible for making sure materials such as homework solutions, section problems, solutions and similar material were distributed to students.
