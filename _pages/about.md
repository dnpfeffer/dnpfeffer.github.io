I am a theoretical cosmologist working towards my PhD at Johns Hopkins University under the advisement of Prof. Marc Kamionkowsk.  My reasearch ranges from exploring the sources ofultra-high-energy cosmic rays, constraining dark matter models using the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation and using machine learning techniques to extract new information from cosmological data.  Recently I have been most focused on the latter, developing machine learning techniques and exploring new applications of them in cosmology.
