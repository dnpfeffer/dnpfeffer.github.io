In this talk I discussed what constraints the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can place on millicharged dark matter.  The recent 21-cm detection from EDGES lead to a greater then expected cooling of baryons around a redshift of 18.  One solution to this problem is for the dark matter to interact with the baryons and lose energy in the process.  Here we consider the complete interactions of a millicharged dark matter.  This dark matter can scatter with photons, baryons, leptons and annihilate into standard model particles.  Previous works have only focused on a single aspect at a time.  I show preliminary work indicating that a region of strongly interacting millicharged dark matter that makes up a small percentage of the total dark matter that previously was unconstrained to be constrained when considering all affects.
