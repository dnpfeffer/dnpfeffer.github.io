In this talk I discussed work trying to determine the location of the source of ultra-high-energy cosmic-rays (UHECRs) observed in a hot spots on the sky.  Here we assume the source is local.  Low energy cosmic-rays get deflected greatly due to magnetic fields, but higher energy particles only get deflected a small amount.  Because of these small deflections we can do simple modeling of what the observed UHECR spectrum from a local source would look like.  A local source would have a different energy and angular distribution then a diffuse background of UHECRs and we look at how easy it is to detect the difference.
