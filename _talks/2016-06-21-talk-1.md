A talk about my work in [Tidal disruption events as UHECR source]({{ absolute_url }}{% link _publications/2016-12-23-UHECR-TDEs-hotspot-number-1.md %}).  Here we propose Tidal disruption events (TDEs) as the source of observed ultra-high-energy cosmic-rays (UHECRs).  We show that there is a high enough energy density of UHECRs that can be produced from TDEs to account for our observed UHECR flux.
