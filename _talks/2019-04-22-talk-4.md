In this work we present the first application of a convolution neural network (CNN) to directly determine the underlying luminosity function of a line intensity map (IM) including a full treatment of extragalactic foregrounds and instrumental noise. We apply the CNN to simulations of mock Carbon Monoxide (CO) line intensity maps of the same sky area and frequency coverage as the near-future COMAP experiment. We evaluate the trained CNN on a number of noise scenarios in order to determine how robust the network predictions are for realistic data, where one may not know the true amplitude and shape of the instrumental noise or foreground signal. We find the CNN is most accurate below L = 10^5 L_sun and in the ideal case can more accurately predict the true signal than alternative, non-machine learned methods. We then show that when the network is used to predict the signal from maps with different foregrounds and noise than it is trained on, such as the case of using it on real data, that the errors on the predicted luminosity function can increase significantly.
